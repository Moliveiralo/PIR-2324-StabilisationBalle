## How to Use
Before launching the main program Ball_Detection_and_PID.slx, follow these steps:
1. Read the comments in the blue blocks of Ball_Detection_and_PID.slx for program execution instructions.
2. Set up the camera appropriately.
3. Set up the COM port.
4. Run dataToLookupTable.m
- It will charge data.mat which contains the values of angles for the servo motors
