## Matlab
Matlab/Simulink code we modified to work on the Raspberry. The matlab script is complete and working but the system is still to slow.

## Python
Python code we started making after finishing the matlab script, not finished at all. The advantage of python is that there is a lot of libraries being actively developed to work on the raspberry pi, it is fast, it allows multi threading, and it can natively run on the raspi without needing any kind of connection to an other computer.

## Tests
Various test codes to link Matlab and the Raspberry, use the integrated GPIO, and capture images
